# ghostgear

Created for Fishackathon2016.

The problem: many fishermen's lobster traps get run over by commercial/tourism boats, making them unretrievable and contributing to lost "ghost" gear and pollution in the oceans, harming wildlife.

The solution: create an app that allow fishermen to track where theyve set their traps, as well as other boats to see where traps have been set to avoid them.
